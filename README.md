# pyrussianvirtualkeyboard

## What is

A simple and still bugged virtual keyboard for typing and studying russian

## How It Works
1) Launch The Program
2) CTRL-ALT-L You activate/deactivate autocomplention,
so everytime you type a letter on your keyboard, this letter is
substituded with a russian equivalent.
For example:
i -> и
z -> з
t -> т

ecc...

The keymaps are in keymap.py, and you can arrange it to your liking
3) CTRL-ALT-M Show/Unshow the virtual keyboard
4) CTRL-ALT-Q Quits the program

The program is still in beta, so launch it from terminal and if it doesn't
stop, CTRL-C in the terminal to stop.
I would like some help to fix things, and make it 100% working.

## What You Need
1) Python >3.5
2) xdotool
3) PyGtk3
4) Xlibs for python
